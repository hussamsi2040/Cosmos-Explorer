# Featured Series - Specific NASA+ URLs Implementation

## âœ… **Updated Successfully**

### **Change Made**
Updated the Featured Series thumbnails to link to **specific NASA+ series URLs** instead of the general NASA+ homepage.

### **Code Update**
```tsx
// Before: General NASA+ link
href="https://plus.nasa.gov/"

// After: Specific series URLs with fallback
href={series.url || "https://plus.nasa.gov/"}
```

### **Example Series URLs**
Now each series links to its specific NASA+ page:

- **Far Out** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/far-out/`
- **Other Worlds** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/other-worlds/`
- **Space Out** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/space-out/`
- **NASA Explorers** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/nasa-explorers/`
- **Artemis I: Path to the Pad** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/path-to-the-pad/`
- **Down To Earth** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/down-to-earth/`
- **Sci-Girls** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/sci-girls/`
- **Elements of Webb** â†’ `https://plus.nasa.gov/series/elements-of-webb/`

### **Fallback Safety**
If a series doesn't have a URL for any reason, it falls back to the general NASA+ homepage (`https://plus.nasa.gov/`).

### **User Experience**
- Click **"Far Out"** thumbnail â†’ Opens the Far Out series page on NASA+
- Click **"Other Worlds"** thumbnail â†’ Opens the Other Worlds series page on NASA+
- Click **"Space Out"** thumbnail â†’ Opens the Space Out series page on NASA+
- And so on for each series...

### **Data Source**
The URLs come directly from the scraped NASA+ data, ensuring they're always current and accurate.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**
Users now get taken directly to the specific series they're interested in on the official NASA+ platform, providing a much more targeted and useful experience!
